```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```
## Dataset

### Data
**Source**: PIERAN DATA

### Data Preprocessing
- Standardized the dataset using standard scaler from sckitlearn.

### Modelling
used only one machine learning model
- **Model**:
    - K-Nearest-Neighbors: used as the baseline model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: precission, recall, f1-score,support,accuracy.

## Results
- **Final Results**: The model attained an Accuracy Score of **84%**
